title: Rollercoaster Ranking Project
---
Nowadays, a great many websites provide roller coaster rankings which rely too much on personal feedbacks, misleading the selection of future riders. Our team construct an algorithm to rank the world-wide roller coasters and an app to help people find their best “roller coaster date”.

Firstly, by applying gradient descent with multiple linear regression as well as an innovative approach that follows the intuition of s=vt, the missing data are predicted basing on the originally provided data. 143 roller coasters with relatively complete original data are included in the ranking system. Yet potential best roller coasters nominated by scholarly resources are also included regardless of their data completeness. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) theoretically backs up our model, which condenses majority of informations implied by provided data in the spreadsheet into a single final score expression---including key determining factors weighing differently---without any loss of information. Quantitative factors---height, speed, length, number of inversions, drop, angle, and time---are chosen as key determining factors. Pearson correlation is examined for each factors, which suggests an exclusion of quantitative factor G-force. Qualitative factors, which leave room for interpretation, are not considered in the ranking.
    
The model’s stability is examined by two approaches --- by directly comparing the ranking or the component of each factor in final expression before and after a random omission of small portion of data. Using the ranking system, the world top 10 roller coasters list is generated: 1. Steel Dragon 2000, 2. Fury 325, 3. Leviathan, etc. Comparing our list with two other existed systems, our ranking system that grounds on objective criteria matches two other subjective ranking systems well. 
    
Lastly, we combine our ranking into a multi-functional app- Rolling Date which not only provides objective rankings but also gives personalized recommendations. The Personalized recommendation ranking algorithm is grounded on the previous PCA final score model. Yet it filters out roller coasters with unwanted qualitative factors at the first stage and re-weighs each quantitative factor’s significance basing on user’s provided preferences. The app itself also functions as a social media on which users are able to share their experiences, write comments and make friends. Moreover, this app also suggests routines and transportations and encourage users to try more roller coasters through its point-exchange system.
