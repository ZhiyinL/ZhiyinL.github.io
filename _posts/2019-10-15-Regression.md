title: Suicide Rate Prediction based on socio-economic data

This is a regression project for my machine learning class (Oct, 2019). The project investigates in a dataset that records the socio-economic info with suicide rates by year and country. The project aims to use the socio-economic data to predict the suicide number in a certain country during a certain year.
